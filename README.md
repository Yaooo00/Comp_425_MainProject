# Comp_425_MainProject
This project implements a 3D vehicle detection system based on OpenMMLab's mmdetection3d framework. It leverages both MVX-Net (a multimodal network that fuses RGB images with LiDAR point clouds) and PointPillars (which converts point cloud data into pseudo-images for efficient detection) to accurately detect and visualize vehicles, as well as other targets such as pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, the project compares the performance of the two methods to provide insights for subsequent development.

# Setting Up the Environment
It is recommended that you use Anaconda to build a standalone Python virtual environment. The recommended environment configuration is as follows:

Python Version: 3.8.20 (default, Oct  3 2024, 15:19:54) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]

PyTorch Version: 1.13.1

CUDA Version: 11.7

CUDA Can Use Or Not: True

1. Clone the project code:
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d.git

2. Install Dependencies:
Please follow the instructions in the final_code.ipynb to install the required packages. Ensure that your Python, PyTorch, mmcv, mmengine, and other dependencies meet the version requirements.

# Data preparation
Use the following data from the KITTI dataset ==> https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=3d (Register first)
1. Left color images of object dataset (.png)
2. Velodyne point clouds (.bin)
3. Training labels of object data set (.txt)
4. Camera calibration matrices of object data set (.txt)
5. (.pkl) The information in the pkl file does not need to be modified.

# Data Directory Structure
Ensure that your data is organized under the data/kitti directory as follows (You need to add these files to it yourself)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7393c9fb-980d-4e13-bd25-da2c9f5bb065)

NOTE: Add the above dataset from KITTI to it according to your computer's performance and your preferences.

NOTE: In addition, you need to fill in the txt file in ImageSets according to your personal preferences and goals.

# Generate Data Index
After preparing the data, run the following command to generate KITTI information files (in .pkl format) for subsequent training and testing:

python tools/create_data.py kitti --root-path data/kitti --out-dir data/kitti --extra-tag kitti

# Train 
1.  Training PointPillars
To train PointPillars, use the corresponding configuration file:

python tools/train.py pointpillars_hv_secfpn_8xb6-160e_kitti-3d-car.py

2.  Training MVX-Net
To train MVX-Net, use a configuration file such as:

python tools/train.py configs/mvxnet/mvxnet_fpn_dv_second_secfpn_8xb2-80e_kitti-3d-3class.py

# Testing & Evaluation

The evaluation uses KITTIâ€™s official 3D Average Precision (AP) metric with an IoU threshold of 0.7 for Car targets. The following four metrics are computed:

bbox AP: 2D bounding box detection accuracy on the image plane.

BEV AP: Accuracy after projecting 3D bounding boxes to a bird's-eye view.

3D AP: Accuracy of complete 3D bounding boxes.

AOS: Average orientation similarity, considering target orientation consistency.

Two evaluation methods are used:

AP11: Calculated using 11 fixed sampling points (Recall from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1).

AP40: Calculated using 40 sampling points (finer steps for a more detailed evaluation).

1. Testing PointPillars
Since PointPillars is a LiDAR-only method, use the following command (with --task lidar_det):

python tools/test.py configs/pointpillars/pointpillars_hv_secfpn_8xb6-160e_kitti-3d-car.py "hv_pointpillars_secfpn_6x8_160e_kitti-3d-car_20220331_134606-d42d15ed.pth" --task lidar_det --show

  
2. Testing MVX-Net
For MVX-Net, which fuses image and point cloud data, the recommended test command is:

For the  MVX-Net .pth file, you'll need to download it yourself.

NOTE: Data consistency is critical in the visualization section. Ensure that the image, point cloud, calibration files, and annotation files are numbered consistently. If using new data, rename all corresponding files to the same format (e.g. 000008.xxx).
